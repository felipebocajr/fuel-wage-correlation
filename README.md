# Description
This repository features a python jupyter notebook, that uses pandas, matplotlib, numpy, and other libraries to manipulate a big amount of data about brazil's fuel's sell/buy data between 2004 and 2023, and also the brazil's minimum wage data to get the correlation between them.
With those 23 million rows of data, i needed to apply a lot of cleaning, treatment and grouping, so i could compare the fuel price timeline with the minimum wage timeline, and plot some graphics.

# Using the notebook
In order to use this notebook, you will need to access the brazil's open data portal by the link below and download the CSV files that are named "1o. Sem 2004 - Combustíveis Automotivos" from 1o. sem 2004 to 2o. sem 2023:

*[1o. Sem 2004 - Combustíveis Automotivos](https://dados.gov.br/dados/conjuntos-dados/serie-historica-de-precos-de-combustiveis-e-de-glp)*

Then, you need to extract all the zipped files, and then put these files into the 'content' folder, in order to them to get read  with pandas.

After this, you just need run all the notebook, and see the result. (this might take a few minutes)
